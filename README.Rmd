# Columbo <img src="hex-logo/hex.png" align="right" height="139"/>
A small dataset that contains information related to Columbo - the American crime drama television series starring Peter Falk.

The data has been taken from multiple sources

* Wikipedia [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo_(season_1)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Columbo_(season_1)) 
* Mark Longair [https://longair.net/blog/2017/06/04/when-does-columbo-first-appear-in-each-episode/](https://longair.net/blog/2017/06/04/when-does-columbo-first-appear-in-each-episode/)

## Data dictionary
The .csv dataset is stored in this repository as *columbo_data.csv*

* I have tried to remove text parsing problems caused by special characters but some certainly still remain
* **Warning!** The `description` field contains spoilers about the episodes


```{r echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
tibble(`column name` = colnames(read_csv('columbo_data.csv')),
       description = c(
         "Season 0 is for pilot episodes. Season 10 collates several episodes and specials",
         "Episode number (within season)",
         "Episode number (over all seasons)",
         "Episode title",
         "Director",
         "(S) = Story by (T) = Teleplay by",
         "Actor(s) who played the murderer(s)",
         "Actor(s) who played the victims(s)",
         "Episode original air date",
         "Time of Columbo's first appearance in episode (seconds)",
         "Episode run time",

## A visualisation
A quick visualisation showing the two distinct time periods when episodes of Columbo were being aired
```{r, message = FALSE, echo = FALSE, width = 8, height = 6, out.width="100%", dpi=300}
d <- read_csv('columbo_data.csv')

ggplot(d) + 
  geom_point(
      aes(
          x = episode_index, 
          y = original_air_date, 
          col = factor(season)),
      size = 2)+
  scale_x_continuous(breaks=scales::pretty_breaks(10))+
  labs(
      title = "Just one more thing...",
      subtitle = glue("{nrow(d)} Columbo episodes from {year(min(d$original_air_date))} to {year(max(d$original_air_date))}"),
      x = "Episode number",
      y = "Original air date",
      col = "Season")
```
