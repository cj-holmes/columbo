Final clue/twist: Columbo stages the suicide of Flemming’s mistress, then urges him to confess now that the love of his life has killed herself for him.

0,2,2,Ransom for a Dead Man,Richard Irving,(S) Richard Levinson & William Link; (T) Dean Hargrove,Lee Grant as Leslie Williams,Harlan Warde as Paul Williams,1971-03-01,732,5473,Attorney,NBC,"Leslie Williams (Lee Grant), a brilliant and ruthless lawyer, murders her husband Paul (Harlan Warde) to get his money, arranging the act to look as if he had been kidnapped and killed by his captors.

Final clue/twist: Margaret (Patricia Mattick), who hates her stepmother Leslie, tells Leslie she will go away if Leslie gives her a lot of money. When Leslie pays Margaret off with some of the ransom cash, Columbo, who had persuaded Margaret to demand money from Leslie, has the final proof he needs."
1,1,3,Murder by the Book,Steven Spielberg,Steven Bochco,Jack Cassidy as Ken Franklin,Martin Milner as Jim Ferris and Barbara Colby as Lilly La Sanka,1971-09-15,1035,4365,Best-selling Novelist,NBC,"Ken Franklin (Jack Cassidy) is one-half of a mystery writing team, but partner Jim Ferris (Martin Milner) wants to go solo, exposing the fact that Ferris did all the actual writing, and thus leave the high-living Franklin without his cash cow. However, the pair have an insurance policy on which Franklin can collect if Ferris dies during the partnership. Franklin makes it look like Ferris was investigating gangsters. He tricks Ferris into taking a trip to Franklin's remote cabin two hours away. They stop at a general store, where, as Franklin makes a phone call to Ferris's wife (Rosemary Forsyth) to establish an alibi, the owner Lilly La Sanka (Barbara Colby)---obviously smitten with Franklin---peers outside to see whom Franklin brought with him and sees Ferris in the passenger seat of the car. At the cabin, Franklin convinces Ferris to call his wife and tell her he's working late at the office. During the phone call, Franklin shoots Ferris. He drives two hours back to his house with his dead partner in the trunk, dumping the corpse on his own lawn. 
La Sanka tracks Franklin to Los Angeles when he is out on a date and loudly approaches him, making it clear that she knows Franklin had killed Ferris, forcing him to cancel his date. He takes her the $15,000 she wants for her silence, feigning interest in her. The two have an intimate dinner in the back of her store, then he bludgeons her and puts her body in a boat which he capsizes to make her death appear accidental.
Final clue/twist: After hearing that Ferris habitually wrote down ideas for his mystery novels on whatever paper was handy, Columbo searches his office and house and finds a note with the fake phone call/alibi scheme. He confronts Franklin with it, and Franklin confesses. Upon his arrest, Franklin makes a startling comment: the alibi idea was in fact his, the only good one he ever had.
Jack Cassidy played the murderer in three Columbo episodes: this one, episode 22 ""Publish or Perish"" (Season 3), and episode 36 ""Now You See Him"" (Season 5).

Note: In 1997 TV Guide ranked this episode number 16 on its '100 Greatest Episodes of All Time' list.[1][2] (Coincidentally, in real life Barbara Colby was a murder victim in 1975[3])"
1,2,4,Death Lends a Hand,Bernard Kowalski,Richard Levinson & William Link,Robert Culp as Carl Brimmer,Patricia Crowley as Lenore Kennicut,1971-10-06,914,4364,Head of a detective agency,NBC,"Carl Brimmer (Robert Culp), the very tough, hard-nosed head of a private detective agency, with unfortunate and fateful anger issues, is hired by Arthur Kennicut (Ray Milland), a powerful publishing magnate who suspects his wife, Lenore (Pat Crowley), of infidelity. Although Brimmer indeed finds evidence of her being unfaithful, instead of reporting this fact to his client, he attempts to blackmail Lenore into obtaining business and political secrets from her husband. She refuses and tells him she will expose his plot to her husband, at which point Brimmer accidentally kills her in a fit of rage. He dumps her body at a scrapyard and later joins the investigation into Lenore's death with Columbo. Brimmer secretly starts to divert suspicion away from himself and even offers Columbo a job. 
Final clue/twist: Columbo becomes suspicious when he realizes a cut on the victim's face matches Brimmer's ring. He disables Brimmer's car, causing the vehicle to be garaged for repair. He has Lenore's body exhumed, then claims that one of her contact lenses was not with the body and is missing. He tells Brimmer the lens must be either at the crime scene or in the car the murderer used to transport the body. After searching for it in his home, Brimmer goes to the garage after-hours and searches for it in the trunk of his car. He finds a contact lens, but is caught by Columbo, with Kennicut in tow. When Brimmer tries to throw the lens away the police stop him, and he confesses. After Brimmer is led away Columbo admits to Kennicut he had arranged everything, and that there never was a missing contact lens.
Robert Culp played the murderer in three Columbo episodes: this one, episode 12 (""The Most Crucial Game""), and episode 21 (""Double Exposure"").  He also appeared (as the father of the murderer) in ""Columbo Goes to College"".
Notes: This episode won an Emmy for writing and is known for the ""glasses effect"" after Brimmer kills Lenore, in which both lenses of Brimmer's glasses simultaneously show different images on-screen of him cleaning the scene of the crime.

Brimmer is the first of a small number of Columbo killers who appear sympathetic after Columbo catches them as Brimmer apologetically tells Kennicut that the killing was an accident and that he didn't want to hurt either one of them."
1,3,5,Dead Weight,Jack Smight,John T. Dugan,Eddie Albert as Martin Hollister,John Kerr as Roger Dutton,1971-10-27,644,4361,Retired Major General in the Army,NBC,"Major General Martin Hollister (Eddie Albert), a retired Marine Corps war hero, learns he is being investigated for embezzling military funds, then shoots his skittish accomplice, Col. Dutton (John Kerr). The act is partially witnessed by Helen Stewart (Suzanne Pleshette), who was in a passing boat. She is wooed by Hollister into doubting her own story. Noted Canadian actress Kate Reid plays Helen's disbelieving mother, who is favorably impressed by the distinguished Hollister.

Final clue/twist: After an encounter with his nostalgia-crazy cook, Columbo realizes that Hollister would never have let go of his signature revolver, the assumed murder weapon. Columbo retrieves the weapon, which Hollister claimed was a replica made for his museum display, and the police forensic unit identifies it as the weapon that killed Dutton. Hollister, with his extraordinary self-confidence, had assumed that everyone would accept what he said about the exhibit's weapon being merely a replica."
1,4,6,Suitable for Framing,Hy Averback,Jackson Gillis,Ross Martin as Dale Kingston and Rosanna Huffman as Tracy O'Connor,Robert Shayne as Rudy Matthews and Rosanna Huffman as Tracy O'Connor,1971-11-17,800,4364,Art critic,NBC,"Art critic Dale Kingston (Ross Martin) murders his uncle and tries to frame his aunt (Kim Hunter) to inherit his uncle's very valuable art collection. He later murders his lover and accomplice in the crime, the gullible art student, Tracy (Rosanna Huffman).
Final clue/twist: Kingston hides the paintings that he stole after the murder in his aunt's house to frame her, then arranges for the police to find them. Columbo, arriving late on the scene, accuses Kingston of the murder and says he can prove it with fingerprints. Kingston replies that his fingerprints being all over the paintings prove nothing. Columbo retorts that it is his own fingerprints that prove the case, from when he touched the paintings early in the investigation, when he visited Kingston in his home. Shaken, Kingston insists that Columbo must have touched the paintings moments ago, to frame him. Columbo takes his hands out of his pockets to show that he has been wearing gloves the whole time.

Don Ameche portrays the family lawyer, Frank Simpson."
1,5,7,Lady in Waiting,Norman Lloyd,(S) Barney Slater; (T) Steven Bochco,Susan Clark as Beth Chadwick,Richard Anderson as Bryce Chadwick,1971-12-15,1200,4343,Independently wealthy (heiress),NBC,"Beth Chadwick (Susan Clark) murders her domineering older brother, Bryce (Richard Anderson), after he attempts to break up her relationship with one of his executives, Peter Hamilton (played by Leslie Nielsen), a man he thinks is only interested in Beth for ulterior motives. His mailing a letter threatening to terminate Peter's employment if he didn't break things off with Beth causes her to reach the tipping point and to act to gain control of her own life and, it turns out, the family business (as there are no other siblings). 
Complications in Beth's plan contribute to Columbo's suspicions. Beth had planned to claim the shooting was an accident. She removed his house key from his key chain thinking it would require him, late at night, to try to enter the house via her bedroom. However, Bryce had a spare key which he had hidden under a flowerpot thus entering the house without ado. She improvises as best she can but her story will ultimately be undermined as a result of this turn of events. Meanwhile, her true personality emerges, showing a very different side than that shown earlier, before the murder. 
Final clue/twist: When Columbo re-reads the testimony of Peter Hamilton, who had driven to the house after receiving the letter from Bryce, he notices that Hamilton climbed over the gates and heard the gunshots before the alarm went off, not after. The detail is enough to undo her entire story. Columbo tells Beth that Hamilton won't like doing it, but he will testify to what he knows. 

The Chadwick siblings' mother is played by veteran actress Jessie Royce Landis in her final performance not long before her death."
1,6,8,Short Fuse,Edward M. Abroms,(S) Lester Pine & Tina Pine; (S/T) Jackson Gillis,Roddy McDowall as Roger Stanford,James Gregory as David Buckner and Lawrence Cook as Quincy,1972-01-19,1115,4335,Chemist / heir to a chemical company,NBC,"Roger Stanford (Roddy McDowall) is a chemist whose uncle, David (James Gregory), has taken over a business that his parents built and his aunt (Ida Lupino) controls. David plans to sell the business to a conglomerate, and uses dirty tricks to get Roger to go along. Roger double crosses and murders his uncle with a booby trapped box of cigars rigged to explode as he drives through the mountains with his chauffeur. William Windom guest stars as Everett Logan, the next-in-line vice president whom Roger discredits as part of the offshoot of the murder, so Roger can take over the company. Anne Francis plays David's secretary, who is romantically involved with Roger. Lawrence Cook plays David's chauffeur and right hand man.

Final clue/twist: Columbo tricks Roger into incriminating himself by having him believe the fateful accident was a result of treacherous driving conditions rather than Roger's bomb. Columbo shows Roger a damaged but intact box of cigars and tells him it came from the death scene. Along with Everett, they take a cable car up the mountain. Roger, thinking they are the booby-trapped cigars he had planted, becomes unhinged. He screams at Columbo to get rid of the box because it is about to explode. Columbo reveals that the box is not from the death scene, that he had just got it and scuffed it up to look like it had been. Realizing he has been tricked, Roger can only laugh hysterically."
1,7,9,Blueprint for Murder,Peter Falk,(S) William Kelley; (T) Steven Bochco,Patrick O'Neal as Elliot Markham,Forrest Tucker as Beau Williamson,1972-02-09,733,4319,Architect,NBC,"Elliot Markham (Patrick O'Neal) is an architect with a vision for a city of the future, and a penchant for classical music. His latest project is being bankrolled by the young wife of Beau Williamson (Forrest Tucker), a wealthy industrialist who has been away on a lengthy overseas business trip. When Williamson returns and finds out how his money is being spent, he is furious, and intends to cut off the funds. Markham decides that the only way he can continue his work is to eliminate Williamson. Simply killing him, however, poses a problem, because his money reverts to a trust fund when he dies. Markham comes up with a clever plan to conceal the body and make it appear as if Beau has gone on another long foreign trip. With Pamela Austin and Janis Paige as the wives, present and past, in Williamson's life.
Final clue/twist: Markham repeatedly goads Columbo into excavating a building site to search for Williamson's body, until Columbo finally does so. It yields nothing. Later that night Markham returns to that site with the body, assuming no-one would ever look there again. However Columbo has known what Markham has been up to all along, he emerges from the shadows with other policemen and arrests Markham. Columbo reveals that he knew something had happened to Williamson when he checked his car and found the radio turned to a classical music station, something odd for Williamson, who only listened to country music.
John Fiedler portrays Williamson's doctor.

This is the only episode Peter Falk directed."
2,1,10,Etude in Black,Nicholas Colasanto,(S) Richard Levinson & William Link; (T) Steven Bochco,John Cassavetes as Alex Benedict,Anjanette Comer as Jennifer Welles,1972-09-17,1438,5513,Orchestral Conductor,NBC,"Alex Benedict (John Cassavetes), the married conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra, murders his mistress, Jennifer Welles (Anjanette Comer), after she insists on going public with their affair, and tries to make it look like a suicide. Columbo searches for clues to place Benedict at the murder scene.
Final clue/twist: During the murder, Benedict loses his signature boutonniÃ¨re. While conducting that night's concert he realizes its loss and goes back to the now police-crowded crime scene. He recovers the flower and puts it back on. A TV news team records him leaving the house with it, while the recording of the earlier concert shows him being without it. Columbo insists this proves that Benedict must have been there the night of the murder. Witnessing their confrontation, Benedict's wife refuses to support his alibi.

Blythe Danner and Myrna Loy guest star as Benedict's beautiful wealthy wife and her mother, respectively. Pat Morita cameos in one scene as Benedict's butler. During filming Danner was pregnant with her daughter Gwyneth Paltrow, who was born ten days after the episode aired. The episode was directed by Nicholas Colasanto, who later became known for his role as Coach in Cheers."
2,2,11,The Greenhouse Jungle,Boris Sagal,Jonathan Latimer,Ray Milland as Jarvis Goodland,Bradford Dillman as Tony Goodland,1972-10-15,515,4213,(Unclear - retired?),NBC,"Jarvis Goodland (Ray Milland) and his nephew, Tony (Bradford Dillman), stage Tony's kidnapping in order to break into his trust fund and use his half to hold on to his wife, to whom he wishes to remain married, despite her expensive tastes and separate social and romantic life. Jarvis, disgusted at the notion, shoots and kills Tony, whom he has always despised, once the ransom is paid, and a careful swapping of guns with Tony's wife casts suspicion in her direction. 
Final clue/twist: After Columbo remembers that Jarvis Goodland had years earlier fired a gun at a burglar but only managed to hit a flowerpot, Columbo searches the greenhouse with a metal detector for the old slug. It turns out to be identical to the bullet with which Tony was murdered, proving Goodland killed his nephew, and that the gun evidence against Tony's wife was part of a frame-up.
This episode marks the first appearance of Bob Dishy as Columbo's newly assigned and totally unwanted neophyte partner, Sergeant Frederick Wilson, full of the latest techniques from Berkeley. He appears again in Now You See Him... (Season 5, Episode 5). It is also the first episode in which the main crime is committed after Columbo's initial appearance.

Gloria, Tony's mistress, who believes Tony's wife is the killer and wants to collect a reward, is played by Arlene Martel."
2,3,12,The Most Crucial Game,Jeremy Kagan,John T. Dugan,Robert Culp as Paul Hanlon,Dean Stockwell as Eric Wagner,1972-11-05,1043,4215,General manager of an American football team,NBC,"Paul Hanlon (Robert Culp), the general manager of the Los Angeles Rockets football team, wants to create a sports empire, but Eric Wagner (Dean Stockwell), who inherited the team, lacks ambition. Hanlon sneaks out of the stadium during the national anthem by disguising himself as an ice cream truck driver. He drives to a pay phone near Wagner's home, knowing Wagner's phones have been bugged, during which Hanlon makes it appear he's in his private box at the stadium by holding a radio to the receiver. He then drives to Wagner's house, bludgeons him with a blow to the head with a heavy piece of ice, which melts in the swimming pool, to make it appear to be an accident. Complicating matters is Eve Babcock (Valerie Harper), ostensibly a secretary but actually a call girl and an operative placed in Eric's home by a private detective (Val Avery) who was, in turn, hired by Eric's attorney, Walter Cannell (Dean Jagger). James Gregory plays the football teamâs coach.

Final clue/twist: Columbo notices that the tape of the phone call Hanlon made to establish his alibi, which Hanlon insists was made from his private box in the stadium, did not capture the sound made whenever Hanlonâs office clock chimes to signal the bottom of the hour (the half hour). It proves that Hanlonâs phone call was not made from his private box."
2,4,13,Dagger of the Mind,Richard Quine,(S) Richard Levinson & William Link; (T) Jackson Gillis,Richard Basehart as Nicholas Frame and Honor Blackman as Lillian Stanhope,John Williams as Sir Roger Haversham and Wilfrid Hyde-White as Tanner,1972-11-26,923,5574,Famous stage actors,NBC,"When Sir Roger Haversham (John Williams) realizes that actors Nicholas Frame (Richard Basehart) and his wife, Lillian Stanhope (Honor Blackman), have manipulated him into backing their theater production, he confronts the couple, and is accidentally killed during the ensuing scuffle. The pair cover up the killing by stuffing the body into a trunk, taking it home to his estate, and staging an apparent fall down the stairs. 
Columbo is visiting London to study British police techniques as the guest of Scotland Yard Detective Chief Superintendent William Durk (Bernard Fox), who is called to investigate the incident. Sharon Johansen plays Miss Dudley, an attractive young understudy Frame has his eye on, and thus intensely disliked by Stanhope. Wilfrid Hyde-White plays the butler who covers for the couple but later tries to blackmail them and is murdered by Frame. Arthur Malet is the theater doorman who comes into possession of the dead man's umbrella, which becomes vital to the resolution of the case.
Final clue/twist: Columbo engineers a situation whereby, before witnesses, they search the dead manâs closed umbrella, on exhibit in a wax museum, for a pearl from Lillian Stanhope's broken necklace. According to Columbo this could only have gotten there during the killing. When the umbrella is opened and a pearl is revealed, the increasingly unstable Frame starts babbling, and Stanhope, now overwhelmed, confesses to how they killed Sir Roger. (Columbo had, however, used his childhood marble-playing skills to shoot the pearl into the umbrella moments before it was opened.)

The first of several episodes to feature locations outside the United States, it was filmed in both London and Hollywood. Although scenes with Wilfrid Hyde-White were set in London, due to the actor's tax problems all his character's scenes were filmed in California."
2,5,14,Requiem for a Falling Star,Richard Quine,Jackson Gillis,Anne Baxter as Nora Chandler,Pippa Scott as Jean Davis and John Colicos as Al Cumberland (photograph),1973-01-21,695,4214,Movie star,NBC,"Jean Davis (Pippa Scott), personal assistant to aging movie star Nora Chandler (Anne Baxter), is married to gossip reporter Jerry Parks (Mel Ferrer), and she has secret information about Chandler. One night Nora deflates the tire of Jean's car so that the engaged couple will have to switch vehicles. Chandler starts a gasoline fire just as Parks's car (being driven by Davis) pulls into his garage. It initially appears that the murderer's intended victim was Parks, but actually Jean was the target. Columbo solves the case after connecting it to the mysterious disappearance of Chandler's husband a decade earlier. Kevin McCarthy appears as a physician and friend of Chandler. 
Final clue/twist: Columbo is not sure of anything. He watches one of Nora's old movies in which she disguised herself as a man to commit a murder. He remembers some facts about the disappearance of her husband years before, that the fountain in Nora's garden does not work, and learns it was purchased the day after her husband disappeared. He tricks Nora into thinking her husband's body might have been discovered. When she rushes home and runs straight to her garden, Columbo, lying in wait, confronts her. She confesses that she killed her husband and buried his body under the fountain, and that Jean knew it and that is why she killed her.

Oscar-winning costume designer Edith Head made a cameo appearance as herself."
2,6,15,A Stitch in Crime,Hy Averback,Shirl Hendryx,Leonard Nimoy as Barry Mayfield,Anne Francis as Sharon Martin and Jared Martin as Harry Alexander,1973-02-11,852,4213,Cardiac surgeon,NBC,"Cardiac surgeon Dr. Barry Mayfield (Leonard Nimoy) and Dr. Edmund Hiedemann (Will Geer) have pioneered a major medical breakthrough that Mayfield wants to publish about immediately, but Hiedemann wants to wait and do more tests. When Dr. Hiedemann's heart condition worsens, requiring the insertion of a heart valve, Mayfield performs the surgery using non-permanent sutures, that will kill his partner when it dissolves in his body.
Nurse Sharon Martin (Anne Francis), a friend of Hiedemann, who has never trusted or liked Mayfield, uncovers a suspicious piece of suture, which she takes with her from the operating room. Mayfield observes her doing this and later kills Martin in the hospital garage parking area, staging it as an apparent mugging. He later tries to pin the crime on her ex-boyfriend, a former drug addict (portrayed by Jared Martin), whom he kills as well. This episode contains one of the rare occasions when Columbo loses (or appears to lose) his temper; suddenly slamming a coffee pot down onto Mayfield's desk he angrily warns him that if Hiedemann dies, the police will have his body autopsied to check what sutures were used in his operation. 
Final clue/twist: Mayfield operates on Heidemann again, ostensibly for medical reasons but actually to replace the dissolving sutures. As soon as the procedure is completed, police swarm the operating suite and search for the removed sutures. Mayfield loses his composure, demanding to be allowed to leave the operating room and shoving Columbo in the process. Just as it seems that no sutures are to be found and that Mayfield is in the clear, Columbo re-enters the doctor's office and reveals that he was puzzled as to why Mayfield, always so calm and collected, would have shoved him, then realized that Mayfield used the scuffle to rid himself of the sutures. Here, Columbo pulls the sutures from the pocket of the surgical scrubs he, Columbo himself, had worn in the operating room - ""the only thing not searched"". The hitherto impassive Mayfield shows the first signs of distress.
Nita Talbot plays Marsha, Sharon Martin's roommate.

Apart from season 10's ""No Time to Die"", which had no murderer and is a vast divergence from the series formula, this is the only Columbo episode in which a murderer fails to kill his intended target."
2,7,16,The Most Dangerous Match,Edward M. Abroms,(S) Richard Levinson & William Link; (S/T) Jackson Gillis,Laurence Harvey as Emmett Clayton,Jack Kruschen as Tomlin Dudek,1973-03-04,910,4215,Chess grandmaster,NBC,"When Chess Grandmaster Emmett Clayton (Laurence Harvey) loses an impromptu game to Eastern European champion Tomlin Dudek (Jack Kruschen) the night before their championship match, Clayton decides to kill Dudek. The hearing impaired Clayton shoves him into a garbage grinder in the basement. Dudek survives so Clayton poisons his rival in the hospital before he can regain consciousness. Heidi BrÃ¼hl plays Linda Robinson, who follows in her mother's footsteps in looking after Dudek. Lloyd Bochner plays Dudek's accompanying coach, Mazoor Berozski.
Final clue/twist: Columbo learns that Dudek's injuries were caused by the fall into the grinder rather than by the grinder itself, and that the machinery automatically shuts off if something falls into it while it is in operation. Realizing that someone wanting to kill Dudek would merely have had to turn the grinder back on after it shut itself off, Columbo concludes that since it was not turned back on it means Dudekâs attacker did not know the grinder had shut itself off. This in turn means the culprit must be deaf.

This is one of two episodes (the other is season 10's ""A Bird in the Hand..."") in which Columbo himself is present at a victim's death."
2,8,17,Double Shock,Robert Butler,"(S) Jackson Gillis, Richard Levinson & William Link; (T) Steven Bochco",Martin Landau in a dual role as Dexter Paris and Norman Paris,Paul Stewart as Clifford Paris and Julie Newmar as Lisa Chambers,1973-03-25,733,4215,TV chef / banker,NBC,"Flamboyant television chef Dexter Paris and his identical twin brother, conservative banker Norman (both played by Martin Landau), are supposedly not talking to one another. But both disapprove that their uncle Clifford Paris (Paul Stewart) has become engaged to young, beautiful Lisa Chambers (Julie Newmar). One of the brothers kills uncle Clifford by dropping an electric mixer into the bathtub while he is bathing, electrocuting him. The body is moved to the gym to make it seem like he had a heart attack while using an exercise bike. Clifford's lawyer, Michael Hathaway (Tim O'Connor) reveals to the twins that a new will exists, one which he is willing to ""lose"" for a price. However, Chambers, who became fearful when Columbo questioned her, also has a copy of the will, and thus she is murdered too. Unlike most Columbo episodes, this has a whodunit element which is not resolved until the end of the episode. Dabney Coleman plays Columbo's colleague, Detective Murray. Jeanette Nolan plays Mrs. Peck, a sharp-tongued, fastidious, loyal housekeeper who is appalled by the ""terrible mess"" Columbo makes in the house.

Final clue/twist: The audience has seen one of the twin brothers commit the murder, but does not know which one. During much of the episode both twins try to convince Columbo the other is the killer. Columbo eventually establishes that two persons must have been involved in the actual murder. Due to the short time frame between the short circuit caused by the electrocution and the re-powering of the house, and due to the physical exertion required to drag the dead body out of the bathtub and prop it up on a stationary bike, he realizes the brothers must have worked together. When confronted, Norman admits to what they did, while Dexter screams at him to shut up."
3,1,18,Lovely but Lethal,Jeannot Szwarc,(S) Myrna Bercovici; (T) Jackson Gillis,Vera Miles as Viveca Scott,Martin Sheen as Karl Lessing and Sian Barbara Allen as Shirley Blaine,1973-09-23,1055,4245,CEO of a cosmetics company,NBC,"Cosmetics queen Viveca Scott (Vera Miles) has developed a seemingly magic wrinkle remover, but her former lover, Karl Lessing (Martin Sheen), a chemist for her company, knows the formula and intends to sell it to Scott's rival, David Lang (Vincent Price). Lessing refuses to sell it back to her at any price, and when he taunts Scott, she bludgeons him to death and covers up her tracks as best she can. Lang's secretary, Shirley Blaine (Sian Barbara Allen), has been giving information to Scott about his operation, and, knowing about Lessing's negotiations with Lang, she attempts to blackmail Scott. So Scott kills her too.
Final clue/twist: Columbo notices Viveca itching and, as he suffers in the same way, he realizes they both have poison ivy and must have contacted it from the same source. Scott suspects the wrinkle remover is responsible for her itching. However, Columbo tells her the poison ivy was actually on the slide of Lessing's microscope, shards of which they both touched â he while examining the crime scene, while she could only have done it around the time that Lessing was killed.

There is a sly reference to the film Psycho, in which Miles appeared, when Scott claims to Columbo that she ""couldn't even hurt a fly"". It is very similar to a notable line said by the Norman Bates character in the 1960 film."
3,2,19,Any Old Port in a Storm,Leo Penn,(S) Larry Cohen; (T) Stanley Ralph Ross,Donald Pleasence as Adrian Carsini,Gary Conway as Rick Carsini,1973-10-07,1156,5478,Head of a winery,NBC,"Wine connoisseur Adrian Carsini (Donald Pleasence) runs a small winery specializing in unprofitable but prized wines. He is about to be named the wine industry's Man-of-the-Year. His half-brother, Rick (Gary Conway), only wants to spend money on various hobbies and interests like sports and fast cars and has also been married several times. When Rick gets tired of Adrian's indulgences, he announces his decision to sell the land to mass producers of cheap, profitable wines. Adrian knocks him unconscious and leaves him to die in an airtight wine cellar. He travels to New York to accept the award and attend wine auctions, at the same time establishing his alibi. Upon his return, he concocts a scuba diving accident to explain Rick's death by suffocation. Julie Harris plays Adrian's formidable secretary, who realizes that Columbo suspects Carsini of killing his brother, and has plans of her own for Carsini.  

Final clue/twist: Columbo realizes Carsini had locked Rick in the airtight wine cellar with the air conditioning turned off, and realizes further that this happened when a heatwave had struck Los Angeles. Columbo steals a very rare bottle of wine (Ferrier Vintage Port 1945) from Carsiniâs cellar, and when he treats Carsini and his secretary to dinner, arranges for the restaurant staff to serve it to them. Carsini, upon tasting the wine, explodes in anger and berates the staff for exposing it to very high temperatures. Columbo tells Carsini that reminds him of the recent heatwave. Carsini realizes that all the wine in his cellar would have been spoiled in the heatwave, so that night he sets out to destroy all the bottles. A heart-broken Carsini is caught in the act by Columbo and confesses, expressing relief that at least he does not any more have to deal with his secretary, who had guessed the truth and was pressuring him to marry her."
3,3,20,Candidate for Crime,Boris Sagal,"(S) Larry Cohen; (T) Irving Pearlberg, Alvin R. Friedman, Roland Kibbee & Dean Hargrove",Jackie Cooper as Nelson Hayward,Ken Swofford as Harry Stone,1973-11-04,70,5665,Sentaorial candidate,NBC,"Harry Stone (Ken Swofford), a campaign manager for Nelson Hayward (Jackie Cooper), is coercing the womanizing senatorial candidate  to end his affair with his wife Vickie (Joanne Linville)'s personal secretary Linda (Tisha Sterling), which Stone regards as too risky during a campaign. Stone is also the mastermind of a publicity stunt that involves fabricating death threats against Hayward, to promote his tough stance against crime. Hayward uses this to his advantage: he lures Stone to his own beach house (while driving Hayward's car and wearing Hayward's coat), where the candidate shoots and kills Stone, making it look like a case of mistaken identity at the hands of the phantom assassins.
Final clue/twist: Hayward, realizing that Columbo is coming closer to solving the murder, stages a phony assassination attempt on himself. He fires a silenced gun through a balcony window into his private hotel room. He later gets rid of the gun. Hours later he returns to the room, ignites a firecracker to mimic a gunshot, and claims that someone has just shot at him from outside. When the police express shock at the brazenness of the alleged shooter, he feigns outrage at them doubting his word, and demands that the bullet be removed from the wall and analyzed. Columbo reveals that the ballistics of the bullet are already in, and that it indeed was fired from the murder weapon. He explains that after Hayward had been alone in the room (a time when he ostensibly was making phone calls), Columbo had searched it and found the hole in the window and the bullet in the wall. He had done this hours before Hayward claimed someone had just shot at him.

Joanne Linville plays Hayward's wife. A young Katey Sagal has a small role as a secretary. Her father, Boris Sagal, directed the episode."
3,4,21,Double Exposure,Richard Quine,Stephen J. Cannell,Robert Culp as Bart Keppel,Robert Middleton as Vic Norris and Chuck McCann as Roger White,1973-12-16,784,4229,(Subliminal) Advertising expert,NBC,"Dr. Bart Keppel (Robert Culp) is a ""motivation research specialist"" who has become an expert practitioner of subliminal advertising (which involves inserting frames of an advertised product into the reels of a film, so viewers' subconscious minds react to what is pictured). Keppel's more lucrative sideline is blackmail: he takes pictures of married clients with attractive women he hired to get them in compromising positions. When his latest victim, Vic Norris, refuses to be blackmailed and threatens to expose him, Keppel plots to kill him. Keppel serves salty caviar at a reception he is hosting for his clients prior to showing them his latest promotional film. Subliminal photos of a refreshing drink are inserted into the film, which, when it is shown, lure Norris out of the screening room. Keppel is supposedly narrating the film as it is playing, but in reality the clients are hearing Keppel's voice playing from a tape recorder. When Norris is lured out, Keppel shoots him in the building lobby. Keppel has already set in motion a scheme to make it seem that the crime was committed by Norris's wife. Keppel's projectionist, Roger White (Chuck McCann), then discovers the cuts in the film and pieces together Keppel's scheme, forcing Keppel to murder him as well when Roger tries to blackmail him.
Final clue/twist: Columbo uses Keppelâs technique against him. He arranges to splice into a film, which Keppel will soon view, many subliminal cuts of images of Columbo closely searching areas where the murder weapon must be. On seeing the cuts, an alarmed Keppel rushes to his office to make sure the weapon is still where he left it. Columbo is waiting there, hidden, and when Keppel retrieves the evidence, Columbo is there to seize it. 

This episode received the Emmy Award in the category for Outstanding Limited Series."
3,5,22,Publish or Perish,Robert Butler,Peter S. Fischer,Jack Cassidy as Riley Greenleaf and John Chandler as Eddie Kane,Mickey Spillane as Alan Mallory and John Chandler as Eddie Kane,1974-01-13,885,4275,Book publisher,NBC,"Publisher Riley Greenleaf (Jack Cassidy) decides to kill his prolific author Alan Mallory (Mickey Spillane), for the insurance and also to keep him from defecting to another publisher. He hires ex-con and avid homemade bomb enthusiast Eddie Kane (John Chandler) to do the job. While Greenleaf is getting drunk at a nearby bar, Kane walks into Mallory's office and shoots him. To cover his tracks, Greenleaf then kills Kane with one of his own bombs, making it look like an accident. Columbo must discover the link between the two crimes.
Final clue/twist: Greenleaf hands over an old synopsis to Columbo, claiming it was Kaneâs, which allegedly proves that Kane had the idea for Mallory's latest book, and murdered him out of revenge for Mallory's having stolen it. Columbo finds out, however, that the ending of the book was actually developed very shortly before the murder, by Mallory and his agent (played by Mariette Hartley), to make sure the book was more appealing for a Hollywood film adaptation. Kane could not have known the new ending, so the synopsis must have been done by Greenleaf.

This episode has a split screen of Greenleaf's alibi and Mallory's murder. Mariette Hartley's role is similar to the one she played in Season 7's ""Try and Catch Me"". Spillane was the real-life author of Mike Hammer detective mysteries. Cassidy played the villain in three Columbo episodes: this one, Murder by the Book and Now You See Him..."
3,6,23,Mind over Mayhem,Alf Kjellin,"(S) Robert Specht; (T) Steven Bochco, Dean Hargrove & Roland Kibbee",JosÃ© Ferrer as Marshall Cahill,Lew Ayres as Howard Nicholson,1974-02-10,985,4225,Director of a think tank,NBC,"When Dr. Howard Nicholson (Lew Ayres) threatens to expose Neil Cahill (Robert Walker Jr.) for plagiarizing a paper from a recently deceased scientist, Neil's father, Dr. Marshall Cahill (JosÃ© Ferrer), director of a high-tech Pentagon think tank, kills Nicholson to protect his son's reputation. He programs a cybernetic robot codenamed MM-7 (Robby the Robot) to take his place overseeing a war exercise. The elder Cahill steals a car from the motor pool and drives to Nicholson's house. In the driveway, Cahill runs over Nicholson, then carries his body into the house, ransacking it to make it look like a burglary. To cover up damage the car received from the impact, Cahill backs his own car into it, with many witnesses to the accident. Jessica Walter plays Nicholson's wife, who happens to be Neil's psychotherapist. Robby the Robot guest stars as MM-7.

Final clue/twist: Columbo realizes early on that Marshall is the likely murderer after finding a burned match at Nicholson's home (Nicholson's wife doesn't smoke and Nicholson himself used a pipe lighter; therefore the match points to a cigar smoker, which Marshall is), but fails to unearth solid evidence against him. Columbo discovers that Marshallâs motive was based on his love for his son. Columbo frames and arrests the son, which causes the father to confess. This episode provides perhaps the most glaring example of Columbo using ethically dubious means to secure a murdererâs apprehension."
3,7,24,Swan Song,Nicholas Colasanto,(S) Stanley Ralph Ross; (T) David Rayfiel,Johnny Cash as Tommy Brown,Ida Lupino as Edna Brown and Bonnie Van Dyke as Maryann Cobb,1974-03-03,1320,5657,Famous singer,NBC,"Gospel-singing superstar Tommy Brown (Johnny Cash) is hugely successful. But he is unable to enjoy the usual benefits of fame and wealth. His zealous wife Edna (Ida Lupino) can prove he had committed statutory rape with one of his backup singers, Maryann. She watches him carefully when he is touring, and even blackmails him into giving all the proceeds from his concerts to her ministry.
Tommy decides to kill Edna and Maryann. He drugs both women to sleep while piloting a small, private plane flying to Los Angeles, then parachutes from the plane before it crashes into desert mountains. Brown lands roughly, hurting his leg. He hides the parachute and lies down near the burning plane wreckage, making it seem like he was thrown clear in a tragic crash caused by flying through bad weather. The FAA investigator (John Dehner) is ready to rule the crash was an accident. Edna's brother, Luke (Bill McKinney) appeals to Columbo to consider the case a possible homicide, based on his mistrust of Tommy. 

Final clue/twist: Columboâs investigation leads him to conclude that Brown must have used a home-made parachute to jump from the plane in midair, which he then hid somewhere in the mountains. Columbo tells Brown that a boy scout troop will be scouring the mountains for any wreckage from the crash. However, Brown seems unperturbed. At the airport before Brown is about to fly off to a concert, Columbo notices Brown taking his car rental keys with him onto the plane. Because he doesn't return the keys, Columbo concludes that Brown must be returning to Los Angeles. That night Brown drives up into the mountains and unearths the parachute, but he is caught bringing it back to the rental car by Columbo, hiding in wait. A relieved Brown asks Columbo if he's afraid to be alone with a killer; Columbo plays Brown's songs and says anyone who sings that well can't be all bad."
3,8,25,A Friend in Deed,Ben Gazzara,Peter S. Fischer,Richard Kiley as Mark Halperin and Michael McGuire as Hugh Caldwell,Rosemary Murphy as Margaret Halperin and an uncredited actress as Janice Caldwell,1974-05-05,927,5643,Deputy police commissioner,NBC,"When Hugh Caldwell (Michael McGuire) accidentally kills his wife during a fight, he calls his friend and neighbor, LAPD Deputy Commissioner Mark Halperin (Richard Kiley). Halperin helps Caldwell cover up the crime, then forces him to assist the following night in the drowning-murder of Halperin's own wife (Rosemary Murphy), a wealthy heiress whose money Halperin covets. Halperin arranges the situation to make it seem that a cat burglar (Val Avery), who has recently been active in their neighborhood, is the culprit in both killings, and orders Columbo to tailor his investigation to that theory. 
Final clue/twist: Columbo enlists the burglar's help in trapping the true murderers. Columbo creates fake files for the ""burglary investigation"" on which Halperin had ordered him to concentrate. While perusing the file, ostensibly to help Columbo, Halperin notes the burglarâs address. He hides jewelry taken from one of the murder scenes there, and shortly thereafter leads a raid on that apartment. Columbo confronts Halperin and accuses him of being involved in the murders. Halperin threatens Columboâs job, and is triumphant when the planted jewelry is found in the searched apartment. However Columbo reveals that he himself is renting the apartment, that the burglar has no connection to it. Since only Columbo and Halperin knew that address, Halperin must have planted the jewelry there, which in turns means he must have been involved in the murders.

The first murder victim, Janice Caldwell, is killed before the episode begins, and is seen only as a corpse. The actress playing the part is unknown."
4,1,26,An Exercise in Fatality,Bernard Kowalski,(S) Larry Cohen; (T) Peter S. Fischer,Robert Conrad as Milo Janus,Philip Bruns as Gene Stafford,1974-09-15,1030,5640,Owner of a chain of gyms / fitness expert,NBC,"Renowned exercise guru Milo Janus (Robert Conrad) runs a chain of successful gyms. His charm is not enough to calm the anger of franchise owner Gene Stafford (Philip Bruns), who has found out how Janus overcharges his franchises for equipment and supplies, depositing the profits in offshore bank accounts. When Stafford threatens to organize other victims of Janus and to go public with a class action suit, Janus kills him. He makes it look like Stafford was working out, trying to lift weights too heavy for him, with the result being that the barbell fell and crushed his windpipe. Collin Wilcox plays Ruth Stafford (the victim's distraught and sometimes boozy ex-wife/widow, who thoroughly mistrusts Janus), Gretchen Corbett plays Janus's secretary, and Pat Harrington, Jr. plays a shifty business associate of Janus.

Final clue/twist: From the way the shoelaces on the corpse were tied, Columbo deduces that Stafford did not tie his own sport shoes. Columbo concludes that the murderer must have put the shoes on Staffordâs feet, when he dressed the corpse in exercise clothing, and only Janus knew before the discovery of the body that Stafford was wearing exercise gear.  Throughout the episode multiple hints to the solution are given (including a sustained close-up of the victim's shoes, Columbo tying his own shoes several times, Columbo discussing his shoes with other characters, and by a character named ""Lacy"")."
4,2,27,Negative Reaction,Alf Kjellin,Peter S. Fischer,Dick Van Dyke as Paul Galesko,Antoinette Bower as Frances Galesko and Don Gordon as Alvin Deschler,1974-10-06,1230,5469,Photographer,NBC,"After years of marriage to his domineering wife, Frances (Antoinette Bower), professional photographer Paul Galesko (Dick Van Dyke) decides to kill her. He hires ex-con Alvin Deschler (Don Gordon) to rent an isolated ranch house. Galesko persuades his wife to accompany him there and she grudgingly agrees. He ties her to a chair, photographs the scene, and then shoots her. He sets things up so it will appear he is elsewhere when the pictures were taken. Galesko meets Deschler at a junkyard. After shooting Deschler with a revolver, Galesko shoots himself in the leg with the pistol used in the first murder, then plants that gun on Deschler so that it will appear the ""kidnapper"" was killed in self-defense. JoAnna Cameron plays Galesko's assistant, with whom he is planning a romantic getaway. Michael Strong, Larry Storch, Vito Scotti, and John Ashton guest star, as does Joyce Van Patten, playing a nun running a homeless shelter who assumes, when she meets Columbo, that he is down and out and in need of some food and a better coat. 
Final clue/twist: Columbo stages a false accusation using a mirror-inverted version of the kidnapping photo Galesko used to fabricate an alibi. The reverse negative shows a different time on a clock in the photo, a time for which Galesko has no alibi. An increasingly riled Galesko accuses Columbo of framing him with false evidence, and becomes more incensed when Columbo tells him the original photo was accidentally destroyed. Galesko grabs a camera from a shelf where there are twelve other cameras, and shows Columbo a negative that is still inside it. Galesko says the negative proves him right about which way the clock is pointing in the original photograph. Galesko has thus given himself away. He had no way of knowing which camera had been used as part of the kidnapping scheme, or that the negative was still in the back of that camera. Galesko, defeated, realizes that Columbo had staged the false arrest with the exact purpose of getting him to lose his cool so he would rashly identify the camera.
The outside set of Deschler's hotel room is the set of Psycho."
4,3,28,By Dawn's Early Light,Harvey Hart,Howard Berk,Patrick McGoohan as Lyle Rumford,Tom Simcox as William Haynes,1974-10-27,1040,5639,Head of a military academy,NBC,"Colonel Lyle C. Rumford (Patrick McGoohan), head of the Haynes Military Academy, an all-boys school, is told by the Board of Trustees president William Haynes (Tom Simcox), with whom Rumford has a contentious relationship, that due to declining enrollment it must be converted into a coed school. Haynes also makes clear that Rumford will no longer be in charge of the revamped institution. Rumford rigs a school cannon by blocking its discharge with a cleaning rag, then modifies a shell with a more powerful explosive so that the cannon will explode when Haynes fires it the next morning, at a ceremonial occasion. Rumford pins the accident on a cadet, Roy Springer (Mark Wheeler), who has a history of behavioral demerits. Eventually Rumfordâs own fanatical sense of duty provides Columbo the clues that lead to Rumfordâs incrimination.
Final clue/twist: Rumford, an absolute stickler for the academyâs rules, is determined to find a bottle of prohibited cider that he knows is on the premises. Columbo himself finds the cider, and realizes there is a connection between it and the murder. He gains the confidence of the cadets who made the cider, and has them tell him everything about how and when it was made. Once he learns that information, he asks Rumford if he had seen the cider previously. When Rumford says yes, it incriminates him. Columbo tells him he could have seen the cider only on the morning of the murder (the cider had been hung out to ferment at night, and as such was only visible around sunrise), and only if he was standing very near the cannon (because of the location of the trees on the academy grounds). So on the morning of the murder Rumford was not asleep, as he had claimed; instead, he must have been at the cannon. 

With this episode McGoohan won the first of his two Emmy Awards for Outstanding Guest Actor in a Drama Series. His second was for Agenda for Murder. Father and son Bruce Kirby and Bruno Kirby co-star, as a sergeant and a cadet, respectively. Bruce Kirby appears in a number of Columbo episodes. Madeleine Sherwood plays Rumford's no-nonsense secretary. Location filming took place at The Citadel in South Carolina."
4,4,29,Troubled Waters,Ben Gazzara,(S) Jackson Gillis; (S/T) William Driskill,Robert Vaughn as Hayden Danzinger,PoupÃ©e Bocar as Rosanna Wells,1975-02-09,44,5632,Auto executive,NBC,"While aboard a Mexican cruise he takes frequently, auto executive Hayden Danziger (Robert Vaughn) has been having an affair with the lounge singer Rosanna Wells (PoupÃ©e Bocar). When Wells threatens to expose their affair to Danziger's wife, Sylvia (Jane Greer), Danziger decides to get rid of Wells. To set up his alibi, he inhales some amyl nitrite to feign a heart attack in the swimming pool, so that he will be checked into the ship's hospital. 
During a lapse in security, Danziger dons a crewman's uniform, sneaks out of his hospital bed, and waits in Wells's cabin for her performance break. When Wells comes back, Danziger shoots her, plants evidence to implicate a band musician, Lloyd Harrington (Dean Stockwell) â who had been in a  relationship with Wells before she discarded him â ditches the pistol, and returns to the hospital before the doctors can find him missing. Columbo, vacationing on the cruise with his wife, is pressed into service by the ship's captain (Patrick Macnee). Bernard Fox and Robert Douglas also guest star.

Final clue/twist: Columbo convinces Danziger that he can only arrest Harrington if they find the gloves he used during the murder, which would have gunpowder residue on them. So Danziger puts on another pair of rubber gloves and, down in the shipâs engines where he cannot be heard, fires a gun from the magicianâs show. The gloves are then conveniently left by Danziger to be found by the shipâs crew. However when given the gloves to analyze, Columbo is no longer interested in powder burns, instead he finds Danziger's fingerprints on the inside of the gloves."
4,5,30,Playback,Bernard L. Kowalski,David P. Lewis & Booker T. Bradshaw,Oskar Werner as Harold van Wick,Martha Scott as Margaret Midas,1975-03-02,1078,4253,President of an electronics company,NBC,"Harold Van Wick (Oskar Werner), the controlling, arrogant, gadget-obsessed president of Midas Electronics, has wired his estate-home with closed-circuit television cameras and video recorders. His mother-in-law Margaret Midas (Martha Scott), who owns the company, and who blames a steep drop in profits on Van Wick's costly fascination with obscure gadgetry, orders him to resign his post by the following morning, or she will expose his philandering ways to his wife, her daughter, Elizabeth (Gena Rowlands). Van Wick has already set in motion a scheme to murder her. He rigs his high-tech home security system and shoots Margaret when she is in the viewing field of one camera, feeding a recording of an empty study to the guard monitoring the estate's rooms. Having already forced open a window and planted footprints outside it to make the murder look like the deed of a burglar, he then uses a timer to play back the tape of the shooting to the gatehouse guard's monitor to make it look like Margaret was shot by an intruder after Van Wick had left the house for a party. Robert Brown played Arthur Midas, Margaret's son and Elizabeth's brother. Patricia Barry plays the owner of an art gallery which provided Van Wick with his ostensible alibi, and Trisha Noble plays her sexy assistant, who may have had an affair with Van Wick.

Final clue/twist: Columbo notices, while viewing security monitor recordings from both before and after the murder, that Van Wick's invitation for the party was still on his desk after leaving for the party. Van Wick had presented the invitation to get access to the party that provided his alibi. So Margaret had to have been shot sometime before the security guard viewed it on the monitor, and, more damningly, Van Wick would practically have had to step over the body to retrieve his invitation before leaving for the party."
4,6,31,A Deadly State of Mind,Harvey Hart,Peter S. Fischer,George Hamilton as Mark Collier,Stephen Elliott as Carl Donner and Lesley Ann Warren as Nadia Donner,1975-04-27,884,4257,Psychiatrist,NBC,"Psychiatrist Dr. Mark Collier (George Hamilton) is having an affair with a patient of his, rich housewife Nadia Donner (Lesley Ann Warren). One day, Nadia invites Mark to a weekend sex vacation at the Donner beach house. Collier shows up at the beach house only to be unpleasantly surprised by Nadia's husband, Carl (Stephen Elliott). The two men get into a violent confrontation over Collier's affair with and drugging of Nadia, with Carl threatening to damage Collier's reputation. When Collier surprises Carl by attempting to leave with Nadia in tow, Carl attacks him. A scuffle ensues, which ends with Collier bludgeoning Carl with a fireplace poker. After telling Nadia to explain it to the police as a home invasion that turned tragic, done by several masked men, Collier drives off, almost running over a blind man walking his dog past the beach house. Investigating the scene, Columbo is not satisfied with Nadia's version of events, wondering why Nadia didn't see the headlights of the burglars' car. When Columbo tells Collier that Nadia's story is not credible, Collier secretly hypnotizes her into, in effect, committing suicide by taking a deadly dive from her fifth floor balcony into the swimming pool below.

Final clue/twist: Columbo claims to have a witness to the first murder. Collier is confronted with the eyewitness, a man wearing dark sunglasses who looks just like the blind man Collier narrowly avoided hitting with his car shortly after the murder. The man settles down on the couch, hands Columbo a match, and then identifies Collier as the driver he saw at around the time of the murder. Collier, as confident as ever, says that he has not been fooled, that he knows the man is blind, and thus cannot be a witness to anything. Collier challenges the man to read from a magazine he hands him, and is stunned when the man does read from it. Columbo reveals that the man is the brother of the actual blind man. But Collier has incriminated himself. In âknowingâ that the witness was blind, he has established that he was at the scene of the crime. He has in effect been an eyewitness against himself."
5,1,32,Forgotten Lady,Harvey Hart,William Driskill,Janet Leigh as Grace Wheeler,Sam Jaffe as Henry Willis,1975-09-14,1372,5610,Movie star,NBC,"When elderly physician Henry Willis (Sam Jaffe) refuses to finance a return to the spotlight for his wife, aging former movie star Grace Wheeler (Janet Leigh) kills him in his sleep, passing it off as a suicide. Their elderly butler (Maurice Evans) believes Grace was in a private screening room the entire time, watching one of her classic films.
Final clue/twist: Columbo believes that a discrepancy between the length of the movie and the time it took Grace Wheeler to watch it, including the few minutes it took her to fix the film after it ripped, proves that Grace spent some time away from the screening room. It was then, Columbo concludes, that she was out committing the murder.
This is one of the only two episodes in which the perpetrator is not arrested (the other being ""It's All In The Game""), as Ned Diamond (John Payne), Wheeler's longtime song and dance partner who has always loved Grace, falsely confesses to save her after Columbo informs him she is suffering from a degenerative brain disease (the primary reason her husband refused to finance her return as the physical strain of acting would have killed her) and likely no longer even remembers the murder. Nonetheless, Columbo is prepared to arrest her. Diamond makes his false confession to Grace who briefly becomes hysterical. Columbo arrests Diamond, both realizing that by the time he is cleared, Grace will have died. Columbo's normal instincts thwarted, he makes several half turns â as though to enter the screening room â where Grace, lost in the past, is watching the film, having already forgotten Diamond's confession. Columbo then leaves the mansion, following Diamond.
The episode features excerpts from the 1953 musical comedy Walking My Baby Back Home, which starred Leigh. It is Grace's favorite film, the one playing when she was committing the crime and the one she is watching, mesmerized, at the end of the episode.

An amusing concurrent side-story concerns Columbo's penchant for not carrying his firearm and his decade-long lapse in going to the range for shooting proficiency. He has been evading Sgt. Leftkowitz (Francine York) whose computer records show the lapses. Finally, while Columbo is eating an ice cream cone with his dog, an Internal Affairs officer tells him he has 24 hours to appear at the range or his badge will be pulled. (Columbo lends his badge to a crony whom he asks to go to the range in his place, claiming he cannot pass the shooting proficiency test.)"
5,2,33,A Case of Immunity,Ted Post,(S) James Menzies; (T) Lou Shaw,Hector Elizondo as Hassan Salah and Sal Mineo as Rachman Habib,AndrÃ© Lawrence as Youseff Alafa and Sal Mineo as Rachman Habib,1975-10-12,425,4256,Diplomat,NBC,"Hassan Salah (HÃ©ctor Elizondo), chief diplomat of the Legation of Suari, an Arab nation with a new young king, has a scheme for shifting power within his government. He enlists Rachman Habib (Sal Mineo), a naÃ¯ve idealist in the Legation, to help him stage the murder of a security officer, then plants evidence to make it look like the work of radicals.  Salah pins the murder on the now-absent Habib, who, as part of the plan, has gone into hiding.  Salah later kills Habib as well.  Columbo unravels the truth, but finds himself stymied by Salah's diplomatic immunity.  Columbo then meets the new king, who is on a diplomatic visit to the United States, and is liked by the young monarch.

Final clue/twist: Columbo gets Salah, still under diplomatic immunity, to confess to the murder with the king listening in from the next room. To stay in the U.S. rather than be sent back to Suari and the torture that it is implied he would face, Salah signs a confession and waives his immunity from prosecution."
5,3,34,Identity Crisis,Patrick McGoohan,William Driskill,Patrick McGoohan as Nelson Brenner,"Leslie Nielsen as A.J. ""Geronimo"" Henderson",1975-11-02,756,5634,CIA agent,NBC,"A CIA operative code-named ""Geronimo"" (Leslie Nielsen) contacts fellow CIA-operative, now working undercover as speech-writing consultant Nelson Brenner (Patrick McGoohan, who also directed), to demand his share of money from a previous operation they were involved in. It motivates Brenner to kill Geronimo. Columbo finds himself blocked at every turn by a man who knows a lot of private and classified secrets, and even by a visit from the Director of the Agency (David White).
Final clue/twist: Brenner's alibi, a taped speech for a client, is proven false when Columbo establishes that some statements in the speech were based on news that was not known until hours after the recording was allegedly made.

The episode features another French car, the CitroÃ«n SM. An inside joke is that the Director's name is Philip Corrigan (aka Secret Agent X-9). In a nod to McGoohan's role on The Prisoner, his character repeatedly uses the phrase ""Be seeing you"" in the episode.[1]"
5,4,35,A Matter of Honor,Ted Post,Brad Radnitz,Ricardo Montalban as Luis Montoya,Robert Carricart as Hector Rangel,1976-02-01,552,4252,Famous matador,NBC,"Retired and renowned matador Luis Montoya (Ricardo Montalban) is a Mexican national hero. His trusted bookkeeper, Hector Rangel (Robert Carricart)'s son Curro is also a bullfighter.  When Curro (A Martinez) is gored in the bullring, Montoya freezes up in fear and does not challenge the bull. He later decides to kill Hector, who knows what happened. Montoya lures Hector to the ring, where he shoots him with a tranquilizer gun, and unleashes the bull on the prone man. The result is that it appears Hector tried to take revenge on the bull that gored his son. Columbo, who just happens to be in Tijuana for the weekend, is recognized by a suspicious local chief of police (Pedro ArmendÃ¡riz Jr.), who enlists Columbo's help. 
Final clue/twist: Due to the condition of the muleta used to attract the bull, Columbo deduces the time frame of the murder, a period for which Montoya has no alibi. To prove Montoya's motive, Columbo persuades Curro to lure Montoya into the ring. The bull is then released, and the ex-matador again becomes paralyzed with fear, this time in front of witnesses. This episode is noteworthy as the murderer's motive is not revealed until the very end.

Montoya watches a film of himself as a matador, which uses footage from the 1947 movie Fiesta, in which Montalban plays a matador."
5,5,36,Now You See Him...,Harvey Hart,Michael Sloan,Jack Cassidy as Stefan Mueller,Nehemiah Persoff as Jesse Jerome,1976-02-29,1352,5130,Magician and club owner,NBC,"The Great Santini (Jack Cassidy) is a magician extraordinaire at a cabaret. He is also being blackmailed by his insatiably greedy employer, impresario Jesse Jerome (Nehemiah Persoff), over the fact that he is actually Sergeant Stefan Mueller, a former Nazi SS prison guard. Mueller tires of the arrangement and Jerome's demand for more money, and kills his blackmailer in the middle of his famed water tank escape act, giving himself what he believes to be an airtight alibi. He sneaks out of a room where he hides during the act, makes his way dressed as a waiter through the cabaret's kitchen and up to Jerome's office, shoots him, then returns to his act with nobody noticing. Robert Loggia plays Harry Blandford, the club's maÃ®tre d' and Jerome's less than enthusiastic business partner, whose personality was such that another character says of the late Jerome, ""To know him was to detest him.""
Final clue/twist: Santini is undone by the used carbon ribbon on Jerome's IBM Selectric typewriter. The carbon ribbon has a clear imprint of everything written with it, so it is in effect a copy of the letter Jerome was typing to send to federal authorities, which revealed the motive for the murder. At his arrest Santini remarks that he thought he had created the perfect murder; Columbo remarks that a ""perfect murder"" is only an illusion.

This was Cassidy's third and final Columbo episode. In all three he played the killer."
5,6,37,Last Salute to the Commodore,Patrick McGoohan,Jackson Gillis,Fred Draper as Swanny Swanson,John Dehner as Otis Swanson and Robert Vaughn as Charles Clay,1976-05-02,814,5519,Heir to a boat-building firm (? Fred Draper),NBC,"Commodore Otis Swanson (John Dehner) is a retired naval officer who owns a shipbuilding company, and is not happy with the shady dealings of his son-in-law Charles Clay (Robert Vaughn), who has turned the modest and upstanding business into a name-brand production line for status-seekers. Nor is he pleased with any of the people closest to him - his alcoholic daughter Joanna Clay (Diane Baker), his middle-aged playboy nephew Swanny Swanson (Fred Draper), his lawyer Jonathan Kittering (Wilfrid Hyde-White), and his shipyard manager Wayne Taylor (Joshua Bryant). He announces at his birthday party his intention to sell the company. That night, someone murders the Commodore. Although we don't see the murder on-screen, Clay is seen covering up the death by taking the Commodore's body out on his yacht at night and throwing it overboard. Columbo investigates with the help of a veteran sergeant and a 29-year-old rookie. The detective's conviction that Clay committed the crime proves premature and inaccurate, an unusual development for Columbo.  Clay himself turns up dead and Columbo realizes that someone else is responsible for both murders.
Final clue/twist: When Columbo holds what he says is Commodore Swanson's pocket watch to every suspect's ear, only Swanny disputes it, saying ""'Tisn't"" when he hears it ticking. The watch was broken at the time of the murder to create a false time frame, and only the murderer would have known the watch no longer works.(Clay's motive for covering up the murder is because he thought the killer was his wife due to planted evidence by Swanny; he was killed when he realized who the real killer was)

This episode departs from the usual Columbo format in several ways. First, the man implied to be the killer is not, and thus the episode becomes a true whodunit, with the actual murderer revealed at the end.  Second, neither of the two murders is shown.  Third, Columbo's personality is atypically agitated, impatient and less superficially amiable than in most other episodes.  Fourth, regular clichÃ©s such as ""Just one more thing"" and ""Something's been bothering me"" are absent from this episode.  Fifth, rather than working alone, Columbo works closely alongside two other police officers (played by Bruce Kirby and Dennis Dugan), who at times interrogate suspects. Finally, the episode departs from the usual style in presenting a far greater emphasis on comedy, including some minor slapstick elements, and features a less dramatic tone."

Fowler drugs a friend staying at his house watching a baseball game, puts it on tape delay, then dons a ski mask and pretends to rob a delicatessen where Claire is shopping. After Fowler knocks the proprietor unconscious and takes Claire's money, he shoots her dead, then ditches the gun and mask. He begins stepping in and out of character to ""assist"" Columbo with the investigation.
Final clue/twist: After Columbo has shaken Fowler's alibi, he confronts him with his biggest mistake. There are no fingerprints on the murder weapon, but Fowler left his fingerprints on the remaining live bullets inside the revolver's chamber.

Feibleman as Milton Schaeffer and Tim O'Connor as Edward Lytton,1976-11-28,1020,4351,Museum curator (?) in the family museum,NBC,"The Lytton family owns and operates an antiquities museum. Ruth Lytton (Joyce Van Patten) has dedicated her life to the museum, never marrying and having no children, although her niece Janie (Jeannie Berlin) is as close to her as a daughter. Her brother Edward (Tim O'Connor) is not nearly as dedicated to the family business as Ruth is; in fact, he plans to close the museum and sell the building, as it's been losing money for years. Ruth and Edward's sister (and Janie's mother) Phyllis Brandt (Celeste Holm) is a checked-out alcoholic who is likely to go along with Edward's decision. Ruth enlists Milton Schaeffer (Peter Feibleman), an ex-con who works as a guard at the museum, and whose brother Tim is having an affair with Janie, in a complex plot where Milton will steal some artifacts from the museum, fake his own death, and then flee the country while Ruth collects the insurance money. But her real goal is revealed when she  double-crosses Milton during the robbery, and shoots him dead, then kills Edward when he comes to investigate the gunshot. She then plants guns on both men to make it look like they killed each other. When Ruth realizes Columbo has not fallen for the staged robbery, she tries to frame Janie for involvement in the crimes.

Final clue/twist: Ruth plants an ancient belt buckle in Janie's room to frame her, and Janie is arrested for the murders. Columbo takes the buckle to Janie's prison cell. When Janie uses it as an ashtray, Columbo knows she has no idea what it is, so she could not possibly have had a hand in its theft. Columbo comes to believe that, many years before, Ruth killed Janie's father, Peter Brandt, whom she was going to marry until Phyllis snatched him away. To protect Janie, who does not know much about her fatherâs death and his relationships with the women in his life, Ruth persuades Columbo not to pursue those questions and in return she will confess to the two current murders."

Hastings refuses to remain silent, even though he is friends with the volatile and egotistical Brandt. Brandt then plots Hastings's murder at the Sigma Society, the headquarters of a Mensa-type club for geniuses, intending to make it look like a burglary gone bad. 
Final clue/twist: Columbo uses Brandt's own Mensa-level intelligence and vanity, along with his dislike of the other people in the society, to trap him. After Columbo presents a ridiculous solution to how the murder took place, specifically on how the murderer timed things so the sounds of gunshots were heard coming from upstairs, immediately followed by the sound of a falling body, an outraged and insulted Brandt shows him exactly how it was done.

7,1,41,Try and Catch Me,James Frawley,(T) Paul Tuckahoe; (S/T) Gene Thompson,Ruth Gordon as Abigail Mitchell,Charles Frank as Edmund Galvin,1977-11-21,1095,4208,Mystery writer,NBC,"Esteemed mystery author Abigail Mitchell (Ruth Gordon) is convinced that her sole relative, her nephew-in-law Edmund Galvin (Charles Frank), murdered his wife, Mitchell's niece Phyllis, in a boating ""accident"" four months earlier and got away with it. Not only that, but Galvin inherited the rights to a play of Mitchell's, which Mitchell had long ago signed over to Phyllis as a present. Mitchell decides to take revenge and murder her nephew-by-marriage. She tricks Galvin into a false sense of security by making him her heir. Then she lures him into her large walk-in safe and slams the door shut, locking him in. Galvin, locked in an airless and sound-proofed safe for the whole weekend, suffocates while Mitchell flies off to New York.
Final clue/twist: Columbo eventually solves the case by piecing together clues left by Galvin as he suffocated in the safe. The most incriminating is the title page of Mitchell's latest manuscript ""The Night I was Murdered"", which Galvin altered to read ""I was murdered by Abigail Mitchell"". At the end of the episode, Mitchell asks Columbo if he can overlook what she did. Gordon's character is one of the most sympathetic killers caught by Columbo and he seems genuinely sorry to have to arrest her. However, he had earlier cautioned her not to count on his being soft-hearted. She pays him a compliment to his cleverness by remarking that, had he been the detective who had investigated her niece's ""disappearance,"" none of this need ever have happened.

Gazzo as Vittorio Rossi,1978-01-30,582,4222,Restaurant critic,NBC,"Paul Gerard (Louis Jourdan) is a renowned restaurant critic, but gets rich extorting money from upscale restaurant owners in return for good reviews. When one of them, Vittorio Rossi (Michael V. Gazzo), decides to no longer pay and expose Gerard, the critic kills him with a bottle of wine poisoned with fugu. 
Final clue/twist: Columbo figures out that Gerard poisoned the wine via the needle of the bottle opener, not in the pressure cartridge itself. He tricks Gerard into attempting to poison him in the same way, which provides the final evidence. Columbo then tells Gerard he suspected him almost immediately because Gerard did not rush to a hospital to be examined after the police informed him the man he just had dinner with died from poison. Throughout the episode, Columbo and Gerard have been respectful to one another, but both finally admit that they dislike each other. Columbo nonetheless asks Gerard what he thinks of the meal he has just prepared, and the charming murderer says, ""I wish you had been a chef"".
Richard Dysart, France Nuyen and Larry D. Mann also appear. Antony Alda plays Rossi's nephew, Mario, who speaks only Italian. Falk's later real-life wife Shera Danese returns as Gerard's secretary/treasurer/mistress Eve Plummer, who is being manipulated by Gerard into managing the slush fund for the payoffs from the restaurateurs.

He fails to name as his replacement the logical successor, TV programmer Kay Freestone (Trish Van Devere), because she is also his lover. He gives her, as a consolation prize, a new Mercedes. She is more interested in a gun he holds while he jokingly invites her to shoot him. Freestone takes him up on it during an important preview for a new made-for-TV movie called ""The Professional"", that she helped produce. She tricks the projectionist (James McEachin) by fiddling with the projector's timer and then sending him on an errand. Freestone sneaks up to McAndrews's office and shoots him, then returns, hiding the gun above the ceiling panels of an elevator, to make the reel change successfully before the projectionist gets back. Patrick O'Neal plays Frank Flanagan, her boss. It was once held that Van Devere's husband, actor George C. Scott, has an uncredited cameo as a television technician, but that claim has been debunked.

Final clue/twist: Kay sees what she thinks is the murder weapon, now visible against the lights of the elevator ceiling. She recovers and gets rid of it. Columbo reveals that the actual gun had been discovered by the police some time before, and an imitation was put where she would see it, to find out what she would do. That she got rid of what she thought was the murder weapon proves she must be the killer."

Ed Begley, Jr. has a minor role as an animal control officer and Tricia O'Neil plays a dog trainer.

Final clue/twist: When Columbo realizes that the dogs were trained to react violently when a certain word is spoken, he has a long conversation with Mason, hoping Masonâs ego will compel him to use the word while they talk. This does happen. Columbo secretly recorded the conversation, and when the tape is played to the dogs they again react with savagery. Columbo figures out the word is ""Rosebud"". Columbo confronts Mason and provokes him by telling him of all the mistakes he made. Mason orders the dogs to attack, by saying ""Rosebud"" sharply and pointing to Columbo. However this time the dogs play with Columbo instead of attacking him, as he had arranged to have them retrained by a dog behavioural specialist."

He, along with his own family and the heads of O'Connell Industries, is secretly a fundraiser and gun-runner for the Irish Republican Army. He raises money in Los Angeles for his radical cause through a charity ostensibly meant to help victims of terrorism. Devlin has a strong belief in honor. Thus, when Vincent Pauley (Albert Paulsen), an arms dealer selling guns to Devlin, tries to skim off $50,000 for himself, Devlin shoots and kills Pauley for being a traitor. With Columbo hot on his trail, Devlin now in possession of the guns must  arrange for their shipment out of the country.
Final clue/twist: Columbo discovers that a bottle of whiskey at the crime scene has the same glass markings that Devlin habitually makes when he drinks from a bottle. Because every diamond has a unique cutting habit, Devlin's ring, which he uses to mark his bottles, is proof of his presence at the crime scene. Devlin accepts that Columbo has caught him, and is only disturbed when at the last minute Columbo foils his gun-smuggling scheme (Columbo had realized the guns were not yet on a ship going out to Southampton, but were on a tugboat escorting the ship to sea; Columbo saw the tugboat had the colors of the O'Connell shipping line).

This was the last episode of the Columbo series broadcast on the NBC television network. Columbo's last line is ""This far, and no farther"", words spoken by Devlin as he marked a whiskey bottle to determine how much he would drink in a session.  These words were taken from a speech by the Irish Parliamentary Party (IPP) leader Charles Stuart Parnell, a 19th-century Irish politician and supporter of Home Rule. A noted IPP politician of the same name as the fictional killer in this episode, Joseph Devlin, represented West Belfast early in the 20th century and opposed the use of violence in the cause of nationalist politics."

Blake and Hall rig a test with a stock set of Zener cards, but the Army wants more proof of Blake's abilities. They bring in Max Dyson (Anthony Zerbe), a magician with a side job in exposing fake psychics. Dyson, who has never failed to expose frauds, comes up with a new test for Blake. Three Army officers drive to randomly selected areas and take pictures of whatever they see. Then they will attempt to transmit those images to Blake with their thoughts. To the surprise and delight of the Army officials, Blake passes the test. What they don't know, however, is that Blake and Dyson are old acquaintances who both did time together in a Ugandan prison, and Dyson helped his old friend rig the test for old times' sake. Unfortunately for Dyson, Blake holds a grudge against Dyson for ratting out his escape plans to the guards, getting himself an early release and getting Blake three more years. Given a chance at revenge, Blake takes it: he traps Dyson in Dyson's own homemade guillotine, and decapitates him. Columbo now has to solve the crime before the government whisks Blake beyond his reach, changing his identity.
Final clue/twist: Columbo tricks Blake into a confession and attempted murder by taunting him with a promise to investigate him for the murder for as long as it takes to bring him down. When Blake tries to kill Columbo with the guillotine, he confesses while he's pulling the plug. But because Columbo has rigged the guillotine, he is unharmed.

Brady and his cameraman conspired to pretend that the woman never made it to the filming, leading the official investigation to conclude that it was an accidental death. Jenny's brother Leonard Fisher (Jeff Perry) shows up in Brady's office with a copy of a film that was left to him by Brady's recently deceased cameraman. Leonard vows to use the film to destroy Brady, who kills him, using one of his studio movie sets.
Final clue/twist: When he realizes that Columbo is coming closer and closer to solving the murder, Brady hires two actresses to enact a scripted conversation in the studio commissary for Columbo to overhear, hoping it would misdirect him. Columbo is not fooled, noticing that one of the actresses was dressed as a nurse when there were no scenes filmed during the studio that day that required one. Columbo then beats Brady at his own game, using undercover cops to ""play the part"" of the commissary staff so they can overhear Brady trying to bribe his secretary to keep quiet.

She is also involved both professionally and personally with her business partner David Kincaid (Stephen Macht). That is, until late one night when Dr. Allenby makes an unexpected after-hours trip to her office and catches David in flagrante delicto with her assistant Cindy Galt (Julia Montgomery) in the therapy room. Dr. Allenby is incensed, and decides to kill David. To do so, she takes a page right out of her own book. She first disguises herself as a sexually aggressive, high-class prostitute named ""Lisa"", wearing a black wig and sexy black clothing, that she stashes in the women's bathroom of a fundraiser she's attending. During the fundraiser, she sneaks to the bathroom to change into her disguise. She then sneaks out in the disguise and goes over to a nearby bar where she's arranged for David to meet with her. Making sure to be seen, she tricks David into taking them both back to her clinic. Once there, she shoots him, then makes it look like the mysterious ""lady in black"" committed the crime. 

Final clue/twist: During their first meeting, Columbo notices that Allenby's new coat still has the price tag attached. He later makes the link connecting the new coat and the ""lady in black"" costume to the same store. He finds the tag in the trash and is able to contact the store where the salesperson who sold the wig to her was able to recognize Allenby from the photo of her in her book."

Brailie is also having an affair with Padget's wife Jenny (Janet Eilber). Brailie is siphoning money from Padget's foundation into what he calls ""The Special Projects Fund"", which is secretly used to finance illegal dealings. The suspicious General asks an employee, Sgt. Major Lester Keegan (Andy Romano) to look into the matter. Keegan finds the evidence but decides to blackmail Brailie instead of reporting his findings. During a training exercise, occurring on the night of the General's birthday party, Brailie sneaks into the mercenary camp, wearing a ski mask, and stabs Keegan, then puts the body on a landmine that is detonated. He sneaks back to the General's estate and makes it look like he was assembling a diorama of the Battle of Gettysburg at the time.

Final clue/twist: Columbo realized that a shipping box labeled as having contained books (which Brailie received earlier on the day of the murder) was too small to contain the number of books it was supposed to contain, and thus the box must have instead contained the toy soldiers for the diorama, and the books must have arrived in a shipment that arrived later (which Brailie claimed contained the toy soldiers). This meant that Brailie had swapped the labels on the boxes and had had enough time to set up the diorama over the course of the day, and therefore had no alibi for the time of the murder."

He kills Louise, then makes it look like she drowned at the beach while he was at Vito's bar, painting. Columbo poses for Barsini while investigating him.

Final clue/twist: Columbo can prove that a spot on Louise's face was not washed-up make-up but was instead remnants of ""Barsini red"", a special color mixed only for Barsini, and that it was on the cloth she was benumbed with."

Columbo sets out to find the body, eventually digging up much of Brantley's estate and breaking open the walls. But after the search turns into a full-blown media event, Dian resurfaces, explaining she needed some time to herself. Dian and Sean planned the disappearance as a publicity stunt to increase sales. But to his shock, she actually intends to sell now that her holding is more valuable. Sean proceeds to then kill Dian for real and hides the body, believing that Columbo will not be allowed to search for it again.
Richard Levinson and William Link wrote the story for this episode, but were uncredited.

Final clue/twist: Dian apparently left wearing a fur coat. Columbo gets suspicious when he sees all her remaining fur coats in plastic storage bags, deducing that Brantley put the body in the missing bag. Knowing he will not be supported in a second full search, he phones the pager Dian wears as a wristlet: it is on her body, behind a finished section of the replacement wall being installed; which Columbo tears down. (The word Columbo uses to ring the pager is ""Gotcha"")"

Twenty-one years later, Mackey is chosen by a presidential candidate, Governor Montgomery (Arthur Hill), to be his Vice Presidential running mate. Finch himself hopes that he might be appointed as the next Attorney General. Staplin, facing another indictment, threatens to expose the long-ago favor and ruin Finch's and Mackey's political futures if he doesn't arrange the destruction of another document. Finch decides to murder him. He scatters cigar ashes to make it seem he was in a late-night meeting with a contributor when the murder occurred. Finch walks to Staplin's house, shoots him and makes his death look like a suicide.
Final clue/twist: After Columbo learns that Staplin hadn't eaten any of the cheese on the dish at the crime scene, but that the block of cheese had had a piece bitten off from it, he assumes that the murderer must have taken a bite. CSI can fabricate a toothprint from the cheese and Columbo finds more than enough samples of Finch's toothprint on his discarded pieces of chewing gum - proving that he was at the crime scene.

When Adam Evans (Marshall R. Teague), a Hollywood heartthrob having an affair with Lydia, comes under his care, Corman puts a time-release poison made from digitalis under a crown. It takes effect when the couple are together that evening and Corman is playing cards, thereby framing Lydia for the murder. Paul Burke co-stars as Horace Sherwin, Lydia's father, also a dentist.
Final clue/twist: Columbo traps Corman by taking advantage of the fact that Corman was never good at chemistry. He orders Evans' body exhumed and demonstrates to Corman that if there was indeed digitalis, it would have caused a chemical reaction with the porcelain in the crown, making a blue stain on Evans' tooth underneath the crown. Before they begin to examine Evans' mouth, Corman confesses. Of course, Columbo faked the demonstration: there would be no such reaction.

McCurdy impersonates her sister on the phone with Jennings and dumps him. Jennings reacts by killing Goren - twice. He arranges an alibi for the first murder, then returns and shoots her corpse. He allows Columbo to ""catch"" him for the second murder, which he confesses, but then ""learns"" that he had only shot a corpse, so is innocent of murder, which he assumes will be blamed on a burglar.

Final clue/twist: Columbo untangles the plot with his surprisingly detailed familiarity with the location of the tag on women's panties. He proved that someone else put Goren's underwear onto her corpse, and that this someone could only be a man, because only a man would put the panties on backwards. A murderous burglar wouldn't have bothered to dress the corpse; only Jennings would have a reason to do so, to help his alibi."

While sitting at the lecture, they monitor the parking garage using a miniature TV camera and shoot Rusk by his car with a remote-controlled gun, both devices being hidden in their pickup truck's engine compartment. With an airtight alibi, the boys then plant evidence to make it look like the professor was killed because of a Mafia exposÃ© he was working on.
Final clue/twist: Columbo tricks the murderous duo by letting them ""overhear"" details of a car owned by a suspect. After the murder weapon is found in the car, he reveals it is actually his wife's car. Because only they could know which car it was, they must have planted it and must be the murderers.

One day, he gets an unexpected visit from his rival, the chain-smoking newscaster Budd Clarke (Peter Haskell), whom he blocked from becoming the CrimeAlert host. Clarke has resented that he was snubbed in favor of Anders, but now, he has got some leverage that he hopes will get Anders out of the CrimeAlert chair: a porn video that Anders starred in many years ago. Clarke plans to go public with the tape unless Anders resigns from the show. Anders decides to kill him rather than be disgraced by a scandal. He palms a pack of Clarke's cigarettes, which he doctors with a few drops of alkaloid poison nicotine sulfate. Anders then pays two visits to his production office, once that night and again the next morning - so a surveillance tape there will show him at the office all day. Anders then drives to Clarke's house, and switches a cigarette pack for the poisoned pack. Once Clarke takes one of the poisoned cigarettes and dies, Anders makes it look like Clarke had a heart attack at his desk.
Final clue/twist: Columbo can prove that the surveillance tape was fabricated, because the trees and bushes visible in front of the office appeared to have been trimmed in the morning, but had supposedly grown again by the evening. The fact that Clarke's dog scratched Anders' car, making distinctive marks because of its missing claw on one of its paws, provides further evidence that Anders had indeed visited Clarke's house before.

Having previously ensured that Marcy cannot drink by lacing her tea with disulfiram, Creighton waits until her new lover is passed out, then strangles her. Her lover awakens and flees the scene. Creighton enlists his associate, Trish Fairbanks (Shera Danese), to help him concoct an airtight alibi, but when she finds out what he has done, she blackmails him into a full partnership in the firm, wisely going the extra mile by creating a contingency plan to ensure that killing her is not an option for Creighton. Columbo cracks the case, despite the existence of a speed-camera ticket which appears to exonerate Creighton completely.
Final clue/twist: Due to shadow angles in the picture of the speeding ticket, Columbo can prove that Creighton's face was just a flat cut-out mask and that Fairbanks must have been driving Creighton's speeding vehicle, and breaking his alibi. Also, marks on Edwards neck matched the gloves found in the gardener's truck that had been stolen, parked on a particular street where an unusual type of tree grows, and returned. The windshield wiper wells on Fairbanks' car collected the berries and droppings of these trees, proving that Creighton parked her car on that street and also drove the truck there.

But he wants to keep the money a secret from his wife Nancy (Jamie Rose), who is divorcing him, so that she cannot make a claim for the money. Freddy goes to his uncle, wealthy jeweler Leon Lamarr (Rip Torn), who offers to pretend that the lottery ticket is his own until Freddy's divorce is finalized. Unfortunately, that is where Freddy's luck runs out: he does not know that Lamarr has recently gone bankrupt, and is also having an affair with Nancy. Lamarr decides to kill Freddy to keep the lottery winnings for himself. He schedules a Halloween costume party at his house, during which he sneaks out to Freddy's apartment, knocks him out, undresses him, then drowns him in his bathtub. Nancy calls Lamarr during the party pretending to be Freddy.
Final clue/twist: The night of the murder, Brower was taking care of a friend's chimpanzee. Columbo learns that the chimp liked to handle shiny objects, and finds the chimp's fingerprints on a medallion that was part of Lamarr's Halloween costume, proving that Lamarr was at Brower's apartment that night. When confronting Lamarr, Columbo calls Nancy in to thank her for her ""cooperation"" and to let her know she will be the sole beneficiary of the winnings. Columbo knew Lamarr would think Nancy has implicated him, so Lamarr not only confesses to the murder, but reveals Nancy's involvement in the crime.

This episode is based on the 87th Precinct novel So Long As You Both Shall Live by Ed McBain, although not credited as such. Uncharacteristically dark, this is the only episode in which no murder occurs and in which Columbo does not meet the criminal.

10,6,61,A Bird in the Hand ...,Vincent McEveety,Jackson Gillis,Tyne Daly as Dolores McCain and Greg Evigan as Harold McCain,"Steve Forrest as Fred McCain, LeÃ³n Singer as Fernando and Greg Evigan as Harold McCain",1992-11-22,1038,5961,Gambler,ABC,"Given a deadline to pay his debts, or else, chronic gambler Harold McCain (Greg Evigan) plants a bomb under the Rolls-Royce of his uncle, professional football team owner Big Fred (Steve Forrest). The bomb is set to explode when the engine is started. However, someone else gets to Big Fred before Harold's bomb does by stealing the gardener's pickup truck and running him over while he is jogging. Harold tries to remove the bomb before it kills someone else, but cannot get near the Rolls-Royce due to police and security on the premises. When the gardener tries to move the Rolls Royce out of the way of the TV camera crews, the bomb explodes, killing the gardener. Columbo investigates and discovers clues that link Harold to the car bomb, but Harold denies any involvement and tries to divert suspicion away from himself. Fred's wife Dolores (Tyne Daly), appears traumatised at losing her husband but has a good time as Fred's team's owner, but after Harold tries to squeeze her for money, he is shot dead in his cabin, making it appear obvious who is responsible.
Final clue/twist: The TV news tape shows Harold closing his eyes before the Rolls-Royce exploded, thus proving that he knew there was a bomb under the car. Columbo discovers that Harold's alarm was set to 8 pm, not 8 am. Harold had spent the entire night at a casino, where he won $5,000 and had breakfast; then he had a haircut and went to Dolores's house, which Columbo proves with recently cut hairs found inside Harold's hat that was in Dolores' den. Dolores shot Harold and moved his body to his cabin, but left Harold's hat at her house. Before Harold planted the bomb, Dolores moved the Rolls-Royce onto the driveway so the gardener could not drive his truck in. Dolores then sent the gardener to the back of house so that he would not see her steal his truck and run Big Fred over. Harold suspected Dolores was involved and was implying blackmail when he asked her for money. When Dolores demands that Columbo prove it, he replies, ""I don't have to prove it, ma'am. One in the hand is better than two in the bush,"" and arrests her for Harold's murder.
Like ""Last Salute to the Commodore"" many years earlier, the real killer is not revealed until nearly the end of the episode. In both episodes, murders occur off screen, and both were scripted by Columbo veteran Jackson Gillis (this was his final contribution to the series). The episode used footage of a Saskatchewan Roughriders vs Edmonton Eskimos CFL game to represent fictional American football teams with the same initials, the Stallions and the Elks.  Coincidentally, in 2021 the real-life Eskimos changed their name and became the Elks.

This is one of four episodes (the other three being ""Undercover"", ""Last Salute to the Commodore"", and Season 2's ""The Most Dangerous Match"") in which Columbo is present at the death of a victim."

Lisa lures Nick into his apartment, but Lauren commits the actual murder by shooting him and then fleeing. Lisa stays behind in the apartment, keeping the body warm for several hours with an electric blanket until Lauren returns to the complex and begins talking with the building manager (Bill Macy). While they're in the hallway, Lisa fires a shot into the air, then flees through the patio in disguise, making it seem like the murder happened right then. During the whole investigation, Lauren takes all the heat from Columbo to protect Lisa, even going so far as to romance him.
Final clue/twist: When Columbo discovers that Lisa was the only person Nick had talked to by phone in the ten days prior to his death, Columbo searches her apartment and comes across a photograph of he posing next to a one-of-a-kind antique chair similar to the one that Lauren had posed with in another photograph he had also seen. Upon comparing the two photos side-by-side, he concludes that it was the same chair, and same location, in both photos, indicating to him that Lisa and Lauren might actually know each other. He brings Lisa in for questioning and has Lauren watch behind a one-way mirror. As it turns out, Lisa is Lauren's daughter, and when Lauren sees Lisa being loudly interrogated by Columbo's associates, Lauren breaks down and offers to confess on the condition that Columbo let Lisa go. Lauren admits to the murder, but refuses to name Lisa as her accomplice. When Columbo learns that Lauren's motive was to avenge Nick's cheating as well as his physically attacking Lisa with a razor, Columbo rips up the photo evidence implicating Lisa, deciding not to charge the daughter as she heads back to Rome.
This is one of two episodes (the other being ""Forgotten Lady"") in which Columbo allows a murderer to go unpunished.

Fischer,William Shatner as Fielding Chase,Jack Laufer as Gerry Winters,1994-01-10,1322,5310,Radio host,ABC,"Domineering radio host Fielding Chase (William Shatner) faces a crisis when his ward, 25-year-old Victoria Chase (Molly Hagan), decides to spread her wings and leave for New York. Chase is a national celebrity thanks to his call-in radio show and while Victoria works as his producer, his affection for her runs deep. An ex-employee, the homosexual Gerry Winters (Jack Laufer), has been encouraging Victoria and has even found a literary agent for her book. Chase decides to kill Winters. He first instructs Winters to call him at a certain time. Exactly at that appointed hour, Chase drives to Winters's house and sneaks inside. Winters makes the phone call, unaware that Chase is actually behind him in the same room. Once the phone goes to Chase's answering machine, Chase picks up an extension in another room of Winters' house and begins speaking with him. At that point, Chase enters the next room and shoots Winters, then makes it look like Winters was shot by a gay lover.
Final clue/twist: A cell phone is a key to Columbo's solution of the crime. Chase claimed that after hearing the murder on his phone at his mountain home, he started to drive to Winters's house, then quickly realized he should call 911 and used his cell phone. But, Columbo realizes, there is no cell coverage on the part of the mountain road near Chase's house, where his car would have been.

Some years back a group of four men robbed a bank, but all of them were killed by the police in a shootout after they were caught in a car accident. But before they died, they hid their loot somewhere which can only be found through the assembled photograph. Columbo must go undercover to recover some of the pieces, solve some murders to get some others, and all the while trying to figure out what Krutch might be after. Burt Young has a cameo as a small time hood and Columbo does comic relief in the roles of a mob wise guy and a gang boss.

This episode is based upon the 87th Precinct novel Jigsaw by Ed McBain, although not credited as such. This installment thus departs from the usual format by not revealing the culprit until the end of the show. Unlike the previous episode based on McBain source material, No Time To Die, this features a regular character from the 87th Precinct series, Arthur Brown, played by Harrison Page."

He decides to kill Teddy and frame Romano for the crime. To do so, Graham makes Teddy take a big loss at the race track by drugging his own horse so that it loses, leaving Teddy in deeper debt to Romano. Graham then disguises himself and goes to Romano's restaurant, where he sets mice loose in a bathroom. While Romano is distracted setting traps for the mice, Graham calls Teddy from a restaurant phone so that the phone records will suggest Romano called to set up a meeting. Graham and Teddy then drive out to a secluded section of road. Under the pretense of getting fresh air, Graham gets out, walks around the car, steps up to Teddy's window and shoots him, then rides home on a folding bike he stashed in the trunk. The next day, Graham invites Romano to come out to the ranch, ostensibly to pay Teddy's debt. When Romano looks at a briefcase containing the money, Graham shoots him, switches Romano's revolver for the identical murder gun, and makes it look like self-defense. Romano's boss Vincenzo Fortelli (Rod Steiger) becomes involved, exerting pressure on McVeigh. To solve the crime before Fortelli takes matters into his own hands, Columbo must work with the gangster.

Final clue/twist: Columbo invites McVeigh to dinner at Romano's restaurant. McVeigh accepts the invitation, but Columbo does not turn up. After the last dinner guests leave, McVeigh quickly suspects that it is a set-up and that Fortelli and his men are planning an ambush. Fearing for his life, McVeigh contacts Columbo who says that he never invited him to the restaurant but quickly makes his way there. After Columbo arrives, Fortelli threatens to kill McVeigh unless he confesses to murdering Teddy. McVeigh denies it at first, but fearing for his life even more, he eventually gives in and confesses to the murder. He also reveals where he hid the gun and Columbo has two officers quickly locate it. After McVeigh is arrested, Columbo reveals that the whole confrontation was staged to get McVeigh to confess and Fortelli is impressed - as he and Columbo had both planned the set-up."

She will not divorce her husband, rich businessman Clifford Calvert (Barry Corbin), due to their prenuptial agreement. So the lovers scheme to get him out of the way by killing Howard Seltzer (Raye Birk), an investment broker who is suing him, then framing Clifford for the murder. To do so, Patrick drives to Seltzer's house and tricks Seltzer into letting him inside by claiming that his car phone has died and that he has to make an urgent phone call. Patrick then shoots Seltzer and plants evidence to suggest that Clifford was responsible. Columbo's work is cut out for him, because Patrick is on the team handling the investigation. In this episode it is implied that Columbo only has one eye as of course Peter Falk has.
Final clue/twist: At a restaurant, Columbo sees Kingsley move the artificial sweetener towards Cathleen Calvert when they all receive coffee. A few minute later, Columbo sees Kinsley open the front door of a car for Cathleen Calvert instead of the back door. Columbo realizes that despite their claims otherwise, the two knew each other. If they had never met, as they claimed to Columbo, Kinsley would not have known that Cathleen prefers the front seat because she easily gets car sick when sitting in the back, or that she takes artificial sweetener with her coffee. A wedding photographer's shot of the Calvert couple dancing also helps reveal that the cat hair found on Clifford's suit jacket was planted by Cathleen, while an earlier photograph shows that Clifford did not have cat hair on his suit jacket prior to dancing with Cathleen.

As funeral director to the stars Eric Prince, he murders gossip columnist Verity Chandler (Rue McClanahan) when she attends his latest funeral, that of actor and war hero Chuck Houston. Chandler threatens Prince that her next exposÃ© will be about him. (Two decades earlier, he stole a valuable diamond from the body of a deceased silent film star.) Prince bludgeons Chandler with a tool in his storage room, then hides the body in a compartment used for corpses. After the funeral, Prince takes the casket containing Houston's body to the preparation room, where he puts Chandler's body into the casket in its place. It next enters the cremation oven, and afterwards, the ashes are scattered by helicopter over the Hollywood hills. Prince then goes to Chandler's house and fakes evidence of her abduction. So that no one will become suspicious, he cremates Houston's body by piggybacking him onto another corpse scheduled to be cremated.
Final clue/twist: Houston suffered a war injury in which a distinctively-shaped piece of shrapnel remained stuck in his body for the rest of his life. It was made of a strong metal that was not affected by the flames of the cremation process. As Columbo said when confronting Prince, ""Perhaps you can explain how a piece of Mr. Houston's 50-year-old war record ended up in the urn of a leisurewear importer.""

Gabe even penned Crawford's last movie score, which won an Oscar. Crawford realizes he will be ruined and ridiculed if it ever becomes known. Aware that Gabe practices on the roof of a studio building, Crawford plots his murder. He promises Gabe will get to conduct the orchestra during a concert based on Crawford's ""own"" movie scores. While giving a toast, Crawford drugs Gabe, then takes his body up to his rooftop rehearsal place, which happens to be atop a trapdoor to a freight elevator. He makes it look like Gabe was there rehearsing; With the concert about to begin, Crawford starts the freight elevator, then makes it into the concert hall in time to begin conducting before the elevator reaches the top. When the elevator doors open, Gabe's unconscious body is pushed over the side and falls to his death, landing in front of a late-arriving couple.
Final clue/twist: Columbo's first clue is that the victium did not cry out as he fell to his death: On the victimâs body, Columbo finds a cut on his hand in which dried blood reveals the presence of secobarbital, explaining why the victim did not scream as he fell to his death; he was unconscious. This explains why his shoes were two sizes too large and why his house key was missing: the victim couldnât complain because he was unconscious. In Columbo's reconstruction of the Crime clues point to Crawford as the killer. Crawford confirmed just before that McEnery would have heard the elevator that threw him off the roof if he wasnât unconscious.

Price agrees to pay, but when they meet, Price kills him and makes it look like a suicide.
Final clue/twist: Columbo points out that one of the koi tanks built into the dance floor at Price's club contains fewer fish and must be less deep than the other tanks. Columbo has ground-penetrating radar used to find Tony's body hidden under the tank. In the last line of the series, Columbo remarks to a galper ""enforcer"" that ""Tony was sleeping with the fishes."" {Homage to ""the Godfather"" movie series)
(The club scenes use two tracks from the album Tweekend by The Crystal Method.)
